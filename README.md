This is the repository for the FullTimeForce (Technical Task) application, a Flutter application for managing commits in GitHub repositories.


## Features

Displays commits from a GitHub repository: View a list of commits made to a GitHub repository, including details such as the commit message, author, and timestamp.

Example: Users can see a chronological list of commits on the home screen, with each commit displaying the commit message, author name, and timestamp.

Allows switching between list view and grid view: Toggle between different visual representations of the commits, such as a traditional list view or a grid view.

Example: Users can choose between a compact list view, ideal for quickly scanning commit messages, or a grid view that displays commit cards with additional metadata like author avatars.

Dark and light themes: Customize the appearance of the application by selecting between dark and light themes.

Example: Users can switch between dark mode, which features a dark background and light text for reduced eye strain in low-light environments, and light mode, which uses a bright background with dark text for better readability in well-lit conditions.

Allows to search commits: Search for specific commits by entering keywords or author names.

Example: Users can enter search terms in a search bar at the top of the screen to filter commits based on the commit message or author name, making it easier to find relevant commits within large repositories.

Allows to order the commits by ascending or descending: Sort commits based on their timestamp in either ascending or descending order.

Example: Users can tap on a sorting button to change the order of commits, choosing to display the newest commits first (descending order) or the oldest commits first (ascending order), depending on their preference.
